TODO:
	
	- Refine all animations once full moveset is designed
		- includes octogonal direction animations for:
			* walk
			* run
			* sprint
			* crouch
			* crawl
			* all jumps


BUGS:

	- When player lands on some edge and keeps horisontal velocity during landing,
		player will quickly enter IDLE state and remove all velocity (0,0,0).
		 This can result in player coming to an abrupt halt mid-air, which looks bad
	
	- Horisontal velocity is kept when entering landing states, which, in some cases,
		is not desired.
	
	- Quickly doing a 180 after landing while holding 'W', then jumping again 
		will make the player jump backwards.
		 Player should jump in direction of key press
